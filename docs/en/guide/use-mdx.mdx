# Using Mdx

Island.js supports [Mdx](https://mdxjs.com/), which is a powerful way to write content. You can write, import and use React components in Markdown file.

## Markdown

MDX is the super set of Markdown, which means you can write Markdown file as usual. For example:

```md
# Hello World
```

## Use Components

When you want to use React components in Markdown file, you should name your file with `.mdx` extension. For example:

```mdx
// docs/index.mdx
import { CustomComponent } from './custom';

# Hello World

<CustomComponent />
```

## Front Matter

You can use [Front Matter](https://jekyllrb.com/docs/front-matter/) to add metadata to your Markdown file. For example:

```mdx
---
title: Hello World
---
```

> Note: by default, Island.js use h1 title as the title of html.

You can also access the property defined in front matter, for example:

```mdx
---
title: Hello World
---

# {meta.title}
```

The properties defined in front matter will be passed to the component as `meta` property.So the final output will be:

```html
<h1>Hello World</h1>
```

You can see more front matter config detail in [config-front-matter](/en/api/config-front-matter).
